## 📌 How to Use These to Learn Collections

Here’s a suggested learning path:

1. **Start with simple examples** — clone the *java-collections-examples* repo and run code for `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap` etc.
2. **Practice problems** — try solving practice tasks in *Java-Collections-Practice-Problems* by coding your own solutions.
3. **Follow course code** — use *learn-java-collections* to see structured lesson code.
4. **Explore real projects** — see how larger projects use collections in practice (like CRUD apps, utilities, etc).
